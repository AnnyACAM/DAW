                                title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support, and abandoned browsers.</p>
                        <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless
                            efforts of folk like the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, <abbr
                                title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr>, and the major browser creators.</p>

                        <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The
                            Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing
                            designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The <abbr
                                title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> remains the same, the only thing that has changed
                            is the external <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.</p>
                        <p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total control over the style of a
                            hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by
                            demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create
                            beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can
                            always push it further.</p>

                        <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 1 and 2">CSS
                                </abbr> usage. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets, levels 3 and 4">CSS 3 
                                </abbr> should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be
                            provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical <abbr
                                title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2%
                            of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is that your <abbr
                                title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validates.</p>
                        <p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented <abbr
                                title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> by now. When sticking to the guidelines you should see
                            fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the
                            web these days especially when you factor in mobile pixel-perfect layouts may not be
                            possible across every platform. Thats okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design
                            should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over
                            90% of the population).</p>
                        <p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable
                            material to a minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work.
